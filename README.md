# MAT-494-Deep-Learning-SNU
Lab sessions taken by me for MAT-494-Deep Learning (Monsoon-2020) at Shiv Nadar University, India. 

### Lab-1: ML Recap-I: Regression and Linear Models
Demonstrated solving a real world Business problem by construction of different types of Linear Models starting from Univariate Linear, Quadratic, Cubic models and then moved on to adding some interaction terms before finally settling upon a Multiple Linear Regression Model. Commonly used metrics to judge a Regression models performance were also discussed.    
Refer to the folder **Lab-1_22-08** for the R-Code file, dataset and its description.

### Lab-2: ML Recap-II: Classification
[**Lab-2_29-08**](www.google.com)
Did a quick recap of the most popular and commonly used Machine Learning Classifers and covered the metrics used to judge a Classifiers performance for both balanced and imbalanced classification. These Classifiers were then used to solve an Imbalanced Class problem of predicting a Wines Quality from a real world dataset containing details about Red Wines from the North of Portugal.
