# MAT-494-Deep-Learning-SNU
Lab sessions taken by me as a Teaching Assistant for MAT-494-Deep Learning (Monsoon-2020) at Shiv Nadar University, India. 

### [**Lab-1: ML Recap-I: Regression and Linear Models**](https://github.com/Sid-darthvader/MAT-494-Deep-Learning-SNU/tree/master/Lab-1_22-08)
Demonstrated solving a real world Business problem by construction of different types of Linear Models starting from Univariate Linear, Quadratic, Cubic models and then moved on to adding some interaction terms before finally settling upon a Multiple Linear Regression Model. Commonly used metrics to judge a Regression models performance were also discussed.    

### [Lab-2: ML Recap-II: Classification](https://github.com/Sid-darthvader/MAT-494-Deep-Learning-SNU/tree/master/Lab-2_29-08)
Did a quick recap of the most popular and commonly used Machine Learning Classifers and covered the metrics used to judge a Classifiers performance for both balanced and imbalanced classification. These Classifiers were then used to solve an Imbalanced Class problem of predicting a Wines Quality from a real world dataset containing details about Red Wines from the Northwest Portugal. 

### [Lab-3: Wine Classification using Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs)](https://github.com/Sid-darthvader/MAT-494-Deep-Learning-SNU/tree/master/Lab-2_29-08)
Did a quick recap of the most popular and commonly used Machine Learning Classifers and covered the metrics used to judge a Classifiers performance for both balanced and imbalanced classification. These Classifiers were then used to solve an Imbalanced Class problem of predicting a Wines Quality from a real world dataset containing details about Red Wines from the Northwest Portugal. 

### [Lab-4: Demand Forecasting using Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs)](https://github.com/Sid-darthvader/MAT-494-Deep-Learning-SNU/tree/master/Lab-2_29-08)
Did a quick recap of the most popular and commonly used Machine Learning Classifers and covered the metrics used to judge a Classifiers performance for both balanced and imbalanced classification. These Classifiers were then used to solve an Imbalanced Class problem of predicting a Wines Quality from a real world dataset containing details about Red Wines from the Northwest Portugal. 

### [Lab-5: Recap of Classification and Regression using ANNs](https://github.com/Sid-darthvader/MAT-494-Deep-Learning-SNU/tree/master/Lab-2_29-08)
Did a quick recap of the most popular and commonly used Machine Learning Classifers and covered the metrics used to judge a Classifiers performance for both balanced and imbalanced classification. These Classifiers were then used to solve an Imbalanced Class problem of predicting a Wines Quality from a real world dataset containing details about Red Wines from the Northwest Portugal. 

### [Lab-6: General Regression Neural Networks (GRNNs)](https://github.com/Sid-darthvader/MAT-494-Deep-Learning-SNU/tree/master/Lab-2_29-08)
Did a quick recap of the most popular and commonly used Machine Learning Classifers and covered the metrics used to judge a Classifiers performance for both balanced and imbalanced classification. These Classifiers were then used to solve an Imbalanced Class problem of predicting a Wines Quality from a real world dataset containing details about Red Wines from the Northwest Portugal.
